# sales-trends-analysis_powerbi
Annonymized exploration of customer engagement, retention and check- in behaviour for a gym.

### Project Overview 
The goal of this dashboard was to understand: 
* Daily and monthly check in patterns
* Year of Year performance overall (and within each entry type)
* Long terms trends and rolling averages 
* Customer engagement levels with different initiatives
* Demographics of existing customers
  
These insights will help to guide membership strategies, event programming, customer segmentations and retention improvement efforts.

This is a multi- angled view of customer activity in 2025. It intergrates summary KPIs (check ins, individual product performance and demographic insights) and overall trends. 

Date Slicer: 
* Hierarchial "Year and Month" slicer enables filtering across multi- year data and drilled down to months. It allows for easy navigation for time- series exploration.
  
Key metrics: 
* Total check ins: total number of check ins and gym activity within the selected time period
* Average check ins per customer: frequency on visits of an average member, with a higher number reflecting loyalty and recurring user behaviour

Daily activity trends: 
* Total daily check ins (blue line): reflects overall trend acros the year
  - Slicer allows filtering by year and month
  - Visible mid year dips and spikes suggesting seasonal behaviours
* Rolling 6 month average (dark line): trend line minimizes daily noise and better reflects long term directions
  - Visible rising trends towards the end of the year
The combination of daily check ins, and a rolling 6 month average helps to differentiate between short term volatility and long term trends in customer engagements. 

Entry type performance & YoY Changes: 
* YoY change: +xx% shows growth/ decline within each entry group
* Overall YoY change: -xx% indicates overall growth/ decline across the year

Age Distribution: 
* Histogram: shows strong concentration of check ins within binned age groups
